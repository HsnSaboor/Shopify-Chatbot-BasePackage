# Feature Specification: Fix Chatbot Widget Responsiveness and Interaction Blocking

**Feature Branch**: `fix-widget-responsiveness-and-interaction-blocking`  
**Created**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "everything works just need to fix this issue : the widget doesn't adapt to screen sizes;on desktop the chatbot window should take 500px max width and 800px max height and on mobile the chatwindow opened should take 100dvh and 100vw. and the toggle should be the same. the iframe when closed has a htransparent bg with a toggl0e on top from the same react component as the chatbot window but the problem is that the transparent layer above the shopify website blocks the user interactions to the shopify site i.e clicks , touch devices , scrolls , hovers etc."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Shopify merchant using the chatbot widget, I want the widget to automatically adjust its size based on the device screen (desktop or mobile) so that it displays appropriately without obstructing the store layout. When closed, the toggle button should be visible and clickable without blocking user interactions on the Shopify site, such as clicking products, scrolling, or hovering.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a desktop browser (screen width >= 768px), **When** the chatbot window is opened, **Then** the window displays with a maximum width of 500px and maximum height of 800px, positioned appropriately without exceeding screen boundaries.
2. **Given** a mobile device (screen width < 768px), **When** the chatbot window is opened, **Then** the window expands to full viewport width (100vw) and height (100dvh), covering the entire screen.
3. **Given** the chatbot is closed on any device, **When** the user interacts with the Shopify site (e.g., clicks, scrolls, hovers), **Then** all interactions are allowed except in the small area of the toggle button, which remains clickable to open the chatbot.
4. **Given** the chatbot toggle in closed state, **When** viewed on desktop or mobile, **Then** the toggle appears as a consistent 70px circular button in the bottom-right corner.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the device orientation changes (e.g., mobile rotates from portrait to landscape)? The widget must resize dynamically without losing functionality or blocking interactions.
- How does the system handle very small screens (e.g., < 320px width)? The open mobile view should still use full viewport but ensure the toggle remains accessible.
- What if the Shopify site has custom CSS that might conflict with widget positioning? The widget must maintain its sizing and non-blocking behavior without interfering with site elements.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The chatbot widget MUST automatically detect the device type (desktop or mobile) based on screen width and adjust the open window size accordingly: max 500px width and 800px height on desktop, full 100vw width and 100dvh height on mobile.
- **FR-002**: When the chatbot is closed, the toggle button MUST display as a fixed 70px circular element in the bottom-right corner on all devices, maintaining consistent appearance and position.
- **FR-003**: In the closed state, the widget's transparent overlay MUST allow all user interactions (clicks, touches, scrolls, hovers) on the underlying Shopify site, except for the toggle button area which MUST capture clicks to open the chatbot.
- **FR-004**: The widget MUST resize responsively on device orientation changes or window resizes, updating the open/closed dimensions without requiring user intervention.
- **FR-005**: The open chatbot window MUST respect viewport boundaries, preventing overflow or clipping on both desktop and mobile devices.
